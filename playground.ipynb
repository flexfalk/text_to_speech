    "patterns for structuring classes that can make it easier to make them thread-safe\n",
    "and to maintain them without accidentally undermining their safety guarantees.\n",
    "4.1 Designing a thread-safe class\n",

    "static fields, it is a lot harder to verify its thread safety or to modify it so that it\n",
    "remains thread-safe than one that uses encapsulation appropriately. Encapsula\u0002tion makes it possible to determine that a class is thread-safe without having to\n",

    "• Identify the invariants that constrain the state variables;\n",
    "• Establish a policy for managing concurrent access to the object’s\n",
    "state.\n",
    "An object’s state starts with its fields. If they are all of primitive type, the\n",
    "fields comprise the entire state. Counter in Listing 4.1 has only one field, so the\n",
    "value field comprises its entire state. The state of an object with n primitive fields\n",
    "is just the n-tuple of its field values; the state of a 2D Point is its (x, y) value. If\n",
    "the object has fields that are references to other objects, its state will encompass\n",

    "4.1.1 Gathering synchronization requirements\n",
    "Making a class thread-safe means ensuring that its invariants hold under concur\u0002rent access; this requires reasoning about its state. Objects and variables have a\n",
    "state space: the range of possible states they can take on. The smaller this state\n",
    "space, the easier it is to reason about. By using final fields wherever practical, you\n",

    "Long.MIN_VALUE to Long.MAX_VALUE, but Counter places constraints on value;\n",
    "negative values are not allowed.\n",
    "Similarly, operations may have postconditions that identify certain state transi\u0002tions as invalid. If the current state of a Counter is 17, the only valid next state is\n",
    "18. When the next state is derived from the current state, the operation is neces\u0002sarily a compound action. Not all operations impose state transition constraints;\n",

    "does not affect the computation.\n",
    "Constraints placed on states or state transitions by invariants and postcondi\u0002tions create additional synchronization or encapsulation requirements. If certain\n",
    "states are invalid, then the underlying state variables must be encapsulated, oth\u0002erwise client code could put the object into an invalid state. If an operation has\n",
    "invalid state transitions, it must be made atomic. On the other hand, if the class\n",
    "does not impose any such constraints, we may be able to relax encapsulation or\n",
    "serialization requirements to obtain greater flexibility or better performance.\n",
    "ptg\n",
    "4.1. Designing a thread-safe class 57\n",
    "A class can also have invariants that constrain multiple state variables. A num\u0002ber range class, like NumberRange in Listing 4.10, typically maintains state vari\u0002ables for the lower and upper bounds of the range. These variables must obey\n",
    "the constraint that the lower bound be less than or equal to the upper bound.\n",
    "Multivariable invariants like this one create atomicity requirements: related vari\u0002ables must be fetched or updated in a single atomic operation. You cannot update\n",
    "one, release and reacquire the lock, and then update the others, since this could\n",

    "4.1.2 State-dependent operations\n",
    "Class invariants and method postconditions constrain the valid states and state\n",
    "transitions for an object. Some objects also have methods with state-based precon\u0002ditions. For example, you cannot remove an item from an empty queue; a queue\n",
    "must be in the “nonempty” state before you can remove an element. Operations\n",
    "with state-based preconditions are called state-dependent [CPJ 3].\n",
    "In a single-threaded program, if a precondition does not hold, the operation\n",
    "has no choice but to fail. But in a concurrent program, the precondition may be\u0002come true later due to the action of another thread. Concurrent programs add the\n",
    "possibility of waiting until the precondition becomes true, and then proceeding\n",
    "with the operation.\n",
    "The built-in mechanisms for efficiently waiting for a condition to become\n",
    "true—wait and notify—are tightly bound to intrinsic locking, and can be dif\u0002ficult to use correctly. To create operations that wait for a precondition to become\n",
    "true before proceeding, it is often easier to use existing library classes, such as\n",
    "blocking queues or semaphores, to provide the desired state-dependent behavior.\n",

    "conditions are fields reachable from a given object not part of that object’s state?\n",
    "When defining which variables form an object’s state, we want to consider\n",
    "only the data that object owns. Ownership is not embodied explicitly in the lan\u0002guage, but is instead an element of class design. If you allocate and populate\n",

    "a HashMap, you are creating multiple objects: the HashMap object, a number of\n",
    "Map.Entry objects used by the implementation of HashMap, and perhaps other in\u0002ternal objects as well. The logical state of a HashMap includes the state of all its\n",
    "Map.Entry and internal objects, even though they are implemented as separate\n",
    "objects.\n",
    "For better or worse, garbage collection lets us avoid thinking carefully about\n",
    "ownership. When passing an object to a method in C++, you have to think fairly\n",
    "carefully about whether you are transferring ownership, engaging in a short-term\n",
    "loan, or envisioning long-term joint ownership. In Java, all these same ownership\n",
    "models are possible, but the garbage collector reduces the cost of many of the\n",
    "common errors in reference sharing, enabling less-than-precise thinking about\n",
    "ownership.\n",
    "In many cases, ownership and encapsulation go together—the object encapsu\u0002lates the state it owns and owns the state it encapsulates. It is the owner of a given\n",
    "state variable that gets to decide on the locking protocol used to maintain the in\u0002tegrity of that variable’s state. Ownership implies control, but once you publish\n",
    "a reference to a mutable object, you no longer have exclusive control; at best, you\n",
    "might have “shared ownership”. A class usually does not own the objects passed\n",
    "to its methods or constructors, unless the method is designed to explicitly trans\u0002fer ownership of objects passed in (such as the synchronized collection wrapper\n",
    "factory methods).\n",
    "Collection classes often exhibit a form of “split ownership”, in which the col\u0002lection owns the state of the collection infrastructure, but client code owns the\n",
    "objects stored in the collection. An example is ServletContext from the serv\u0002let framework. ServletContext provides a Map-like object container service to\n",
    "servlets where they can register and retrieve application objects by name with\n",
    "setAttribute and getAttribute. The ServletContext object implemented by\n",
    "the servlet container must be thread-safe, because it will necessarily be accessed\n",
    "by multiple threads. Servlets need not use synchronization when calling set\u0002Attribute and getAttribute, but they may have to use synchronization when\n",
    "using the objects stored in the ServletContext. These objects are owned by the\n",
    "application; they are being stored for safekeeping by the servlet container on the\n",
    "application’s behalf. Like all shared objects, they must be shared safely; in or\u0002der to prevent interference from multiple threads accessing the same object con\u0002currently, they should either be thread-safe, effectively immutable, or explicitly\n",
    "guarded by a lock.1\n",
    "4.2 Instance confinement\n",
    "If an object is not thread-safe, several techniques can still let it be used safely in\n",
    "a multithreaded program. You can ensure that it is only accessed from a single\n",
    "thread (thread confinement), or that all access to it is properly guarded by a lock.\n",
    "1. Interestingly, the HttpSession object, which performs a similar function in the servlet framework,\n",
    "may have stricter requirements. Because the servlet container may access the objects in the HttpSes\u0002sion so they can be serialized for replication or passivation, they must be thread-safe because the\n",
    "container will be accessing them as well as the web application. (We say “may have” since replication\n",
    "and passivation is outside of the servlet specification but is a common feature of servlet containers.)\n",

    "4.2. Instance confinement 59\n",
    "Encapsulation simplifies making classes thread-safe by promoting instance con\u0002finement, often just called confinement [CPJ 2.3.3]. When an object is encapsulated\n",
    "within another object, all code paths that have access to the encapsulated object\n",
    "are known and can be therefore be analyzed more easily than if that object were\n",

    "confined to a class instance (such as a private class member), a lexical scope (such\n",

    "together to make a class thread-safe even when its component state variables are\n",
    "not. The state of PersonSet is managed by a HashSet, which is not thread-safe.\n",
    "But because mySet is private and not allowed to escape, the HashSet is confined\n",
    "to the PersonSet. The only code paths that can access mySet are addPerson and\n",
    "containsPerson, and each of these acquires the lock on the PersonSet. All its\n",

    "It also allows flexibility in the choice of locking strategy; PersonSet happened\n",
    "to use its own intrinsic lock to guard its state, but any lock, consistently used,\n",
    "would do just as well. Instance confinement also allows different state variables\n",
    "to be guarded by different locks. (For an example of a class that uses multiple\n",
    "lock objects to guard its state, see ServerStatus on page 236.)\n",
    "There are many examples of confinement in the platform class libraries, in\u0002cluding some classes that exist solely to turn non-thread-safe classes into thread\u0002safe ones. The basic collection classes such as ArrayList and HashMap are\n",
    "not thread-safe, but the class library provides wrapper factory methods (Col\u0002lections.synchronizedList and friends) so they can be used safely in multi\u0002threaded environments. These factories use the Decorator pattern (Gamma et al.,\n",
    "1995) to wrap the collection with a synchronized wrapper object; the wrapper\n",
    "implements each method of the appropriate interface as a synchronized method\n",
    "that forwards the request to the underlying collection object. So long as the wrap\u0002per object holds the only reachable reference to the underlying collection (i.e.,\n",
    "the underlying collection is confined to the wrapper), the wrapper object is then\n",
    "thread-safe. The Javadoc for these methods warns that all access to the underlying\n",
    "collection must be made through the wrapper.\n",
    "Of course, it is still possible to violate confinement by publishing a suppos\u0002edly confined object; if an object is intended to be confined to a specific scope,\n",
    "then letting it escape from that scope is a bug. Confined objects can also escape\n",
    "by publishing other objects such as iterators or inner class instances that may\n",
    "indirectly publish the confined objects.\n",
    "Confinement makes it easier to build thread-safe classes because a class\n",

    "encapsulates all its mutable state and guards it with the object’s own intrinsic\n",

    "2. The Java monitor pattern is inspired by Hoare’s work on monitors (Hoare, 1974), though there are\n",
    "significant differences between this pattern and a true monitor. The bytecode instructions for entering\n",
    "and exiting a synchronized block are even called monitorenter and monitorexit, and Java’s built-in\n",
    "(intrinsic) locks are sometimes called monitor locks or monitors.\n",
    "ptg\n",
    "4.2. Instance confinement 61\n",

    "Hashtable. Sometimes a more sophisticated synchronization policy is needed;\n",
    "Chapter 11 shows how to improve scalability through finer-grained locking strate\u0002gies. The primary advantage of the Java monitor pattern is its simplicity.\n",
    "The Java monitor pattern is merely a convention; any lock object could be used\n",
    "to guard an object’s state so long as it is used consistently. Listing 4.3 illustrates a\n",

    "Listing 4.3. Guarding state with a private lock.\n",
    "There are advantages to using a private lock object instead of an object’s in\u0002trinsic lock (or any other publicly accessible lock). Making the lock object private\n",
    "encapsulates the lock so that client code cannot acquire it, whereas a publicly\n",
    "accessible lock allows client code to participate in its synchronization policy—\n",
    "correctly or incorrectly. Clients that improperly acquire another object’s lock\n",
    "could cause liveness problems, and verifying that a publicly accessible lock is\n",
    "properly used requires examining the entire program rather than a single class.\n",
    "4.2.2 Example: tracking fleet vehicles\n",
    "Counter in Listing 4.1 is a concise, but trivial, example of the Java monitor pattern.\n",
    "Let’s build a slightly less trivial example: a “vehicle tracker” for dispatching\n",
    "fleet vehicles such as taxicabs, police cars, or delivery trucks. We’ll build it first\n",
    "using the monitor pattern, and then see how to relax some of the encapsulation\n",
    "requirements while retaining thread safety.\n",
    "Each vehicle is identified by a String and has a location represented by (x, y)\n",
    "coordinates. The VehicleTracker classes encapsulate the identity and locations\n",
    "of the known vehicles, making them well-suited as a data model in a model\u0002view-controller GUI application where it might be shared by a view thread and\n",
    "multiple updater threads. The view thread would fetch the names and locations\n",
    "of the vehicles and render them on a display:\n",
    "Map<String, Point> locations = vehicles.getLocations();\n",
    "for (String key : locations.keySet())\n",
    "renderVehicle(key, locations.get(key));\n",
    "ptg\n",
    "62 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\n",
    "Similarly, the updater threads would modify vehicle locations with data re\u0002ceived from GPS devices or entered manually by a dispatcher through a GUI\n",

    "vehicle tracker using the Java monitor pattern that uses MutablePoint in Listing\n",
    "4.5 for representing the vehicle locations.\n",
    "Even though MutablePoint is not thread-safe, the tracker class is. Neither the\n",
    "map nor any of the mutable points it contains is ever published. When we need to\n",
    "return vehicle locations to callers, the appropriate values are copied using either\n",
    "the MutablePoint copy constructor or deepCopy, which creates a new Map whose\n",
    "values are copies of the keys and values from the old Map.\n",

    "This implementation maintains thread safety in part by copying mutable data\n",
    "before returning it to the client. This is usually not a performance issue, but could\n",
    "become one if the set of vehicles is very large.4 Another consequence of copying\n",
    "the data on each call to getLocation is that the contents of the returned collection\n",
    "do not change even if the underlying locations change. Whether this is good or\n",
    "bad depends on your requirements. It could be a benefit if there are internal\n",
    "consistency requirements on the location set, in which case returning a consistent\n",
    "snapshot is critical, or a drawback if callers require up-to-date information for\n",
    "each vehicle and therefore need to refresh their snapshot more often.\n",

    "All but the most trivial objects are composite objects. The Java monitor pattern\n",
    "is useful when building classes from scratch or composing classes out of objects\n",
    "that are not thread-safe. But what if the components of our class are already\n",

    "is . . . “it depends”. In some cases a composite made of thread-safe components is\n",

    "4.10).\n",
    "In CountingFactorizer on page 23, we added an AtomicLong to an otherwise\n",
    "stateless object, and the resulting composite object was still thread-safe. Since the\n",

    "CountingFactorizer imposes no additional validity constraints on the state of the\n",
    "3. Note that deepCopy can’t just wrap the Map with an unmodifiableMap, because that protects only\n",
    "the collection from modification; it does not prevent callers from modifying the mutable objects stored\n",
    "in it. For the same reason, populating the HashMap in deepCopy via a copy constructor wouldn’t work\n",
    "either, because only the references to the points would be copied, not the point objects themselves.\n",
    "4. Because deepCopy is called from a synchronized method, the tracker’s intrinsic lock is held for the\n",

This chapter covers\\npatterns for structuring classes that can make it easier to make them thread-safe\\nand to maintain them without accidentally undermining their safety guarantees.\\n4.1 Designing a thread-safe class\\nWhile it is possible to write a thread-safe program that stores all its state in public\\nstatic fields, it is a lot harder to verify its thread safety or to modify it so that it\\nremains thread-safe than one that uses encapsulation appropriately. Encapsula\\x02tion makes it possible to determine that a class is thread-safe without having to\\nexamine the entire program.\\nThe design process for a thread-safe class should include these three basic\\nelements:\\n• Identify the variables that form the object’s state;\\n• Identify the invariants that constrain the state variables;\\n• Establish a policy for managing concurrent access to the object’s\\nstate.\\nAn object’s state starts with its fields. If they are all of primitive type, the\\nfields comprise the entire state. Counter in Listing 4.1 has only one field, so the\\nvalue field comprises its entire state. The state of an object with n primitive fields\\nis just the n-tuple of its field values; the state of a 2D Point is its (x, y) value. If\\nthe object has fields that are references to other objects, its state will encompass\\nfields from the referenced objects as well. For example, the state of a LinkedList\\nincludes the state of all the link node objects belonging to the list.\\nThe synchronization policy defines how an object coordinates access to its state\\nwithout violating its invariants or postconditions. It specifies what combination of\\n55\\nptg\\n56 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\n@ThreadSafe\\npublic final class Counter {\\n@GuardedBy(\"this\") private long value = 0;\\npublic synchronized long getValue() {\\nreturn value;\\n}\\npublic synchronized long increment() {\\nif (value == Long.MAX_VALUE)\\nthrow new IllegalStateException(\"counter overflow\");\\nreturn ++value;\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.1. Simple thread-safe counter using the Java monitor pattern.\\nimmutability, thread confinement, and locking is used to maintain thread safety,\\nand which variables are guarded by which locks. To ensure that the class can be\\nanalyzed and maintained, document the synchronization policy.\\n4.1.1 Gathering synchronization requirements\\nMaking a class thread-safe means ensuring that its invariants hold under concur\\x02rent access; this requires reasoning about its state. Objects and variables have a\\nstate space: the range of possible states they can take on. The smaller this state\\nspace, the easier it is to reason about. By using final fields wherever practical, you\\nmake it simpler to analyze the possible states an object can be in. (In the extreme\\ncase, immutable objects can only be in a single state.)\\nMany classes have invariants that identify certain states as valid or invalid.\\nThe value field in Counter is a long. The state space of a long ranges from\\nLong.MIN_VALUE to Long.MAX_VALUE, but Counter places constraints on value;\\nnegative values are not allowed.\\nSimilarly, operations may have postconditions that identify certain state transi\\x02tions as invalid. If the current state of a Counter is 17, the only valid next state is\\n18. When the next state is derived from the current state, the operation is neces\\x02sarily a compound action. Not all operations impose state transition constraints;\\nwhen updating a variable that holds the current temperature, its previous state\\ndoes not affect the computation.\\nConstraints placed on states or state transitions by invariants and postcondi\\x02tions create additional synchronization or encapsulation requirements. If certain\\nstates are invalid, then the underlying state variables must be encapsulated, oth\\x02erwise client code could put the object into an invalid state. If an operation has\\ninvalid state transitions, it must be made atomic. On the other hand, if the class\\ndoes not impose any such constraints, we may be able to relax encapsulation or\\nserialization requirements to obtain greater flexibility or better performance.\\nptg\\n4.1. Designing a thread-safe class 57\\nA class can also have invariants that constrain multiple state variables. A num\\x02ber range class, like NumberRange in Listing 4.10, typically maintains state vari\\x02ables for the lower and upper bounds of the range. These variables must obey\\nthe constraint that the lower bound be less than or equal to the upper bound.\\nMultivariable invariants like this one create atomicity requirements: related vari\\x02ables must be fetched or updated in a single atomic operation. You cannot update\\none, release and reacquire the lock, and then update the others, since this could\\ninvolve leaving the object in an invalid state when the lock was released. When\\nmultiple variables participate in an invariant, the lock that guards them must be\\nheld for the duration of any operation that accesses the related variables.\\nYou cannot ensure thread safety without understanding an object’s invari\\x02ants and postconditions. Constraints on the valid values or state transi\\x02tions for state variables can create atomicity and encapsulation require\\x02ments.\\n4.1.2 State-dependent operations\\nClass invariants and method postconditions constrain the valid states and state\\ntransitions for an object. Some objects also have methods with state-based precon\\x02ditions. For example, you cannot remove an item from an empty queue; a queue\\nmust be in the “nonempty” state before you can remove an element. Operations\\nwith state-based preconditions are called state-dependent [CPJ 3].\\nIn a single-threaded program, if a precondition does not hold, the operation\\nhas no choice but to fail. But in a concurrent program, the precondition may be\\x02come true later due to the action of another thread. Concurrent programs add the\\npossibility of waiting until the precondition becomes true, and then proceeding\\nwith the operation.\\nThe built-in mechanisms for efficiently waiting for a condition to become\\ntrue—wait and notify—are tightly bound to intrinsic locking, and can be dif\\x02ficult to use correctly. To create operations that wait for a precondition to become\\ntrue before proceeding, it is often easier to use existing library classes, such as\\nblocking queues or semaphores, to provide the desired state-dependent behavior.\\nBlocking library classes such as BlockingQueue, Semaphore, and other synchroniz\\x02ers are covered in Chapter 5; creating state-dependent classes using the low-level\\nmechanisms provided by the platform and class library is covered in Chapter 14.\\n4.1.3 State ownership\\nWe implied in Section 4.1 that an object’s state could be a subset of the fields in\\nthe object graph rooted at that object. Why might it be a subset? Under what\\nconditions are fields reachable from a given object not part of that object’s state?\\nWhen defining which variables form an object’s state, we want to consider\\nonly the data that object owns. Ownership is not embodied explicitly in the lan\\x02guage, but is instead an element of class design. If you allocate and populate\\nptg\\n58 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\na HashMap, you are creating multiple objects: the HashMap object, a number of\\nMap.Entry objects used by the implementation of HashMap, and perhaps other in\\x02ternal objects as well. The logical state of a HashMap includes the state of all its\\nMap.Entry and internal objects, even though they are implemented as separate\\nobjects.\\nFor better or worse, garbage collection lets us avoid thinking carefully about\\nownership. When passing an object to a method in C++, you have to think fairly\\ncarefully about whether you are transferring ownership, engaging in a short-term\\nloan, or envisioning long-term joint ownership. In Java, all these same ownership\\nmodels are possible, but the garbage collector reduces the cost of many of the\\ncommon errors in reference sharing, enabling less-than-precise thinking about\\nownership.\\nIn many cases, ownership and encapsulation go together—the object encapsu\\x02lates the state it owns and owns the state it encapsulates. It is the owner of a given\\nstate variable that gets to decide on the locking protocol used to maintain the in\\x02tegrity of that variable’s state. Ownership implies control, but once you publish\\na reference to a mutable object, you no longer have exclusive control; at best, you\\nmight have “shared ownership”. A class usually does not own the objects passed\\nto its methods or constructors, unless the method is designed to explicitly trans\\x02fer ownership of objects passed in (such as the synchronized collection wrapper\\nfactory methods).\\nCollection classes often exhibit a form of “split ownership”, in which the col\\x02lection owns the state of the collection infrastructure, but client code owns the\\nobjects stored in the collection. An example is ServletContext from the serv\\x02let framework. ServletContext provides a Map-like object container service to\\nservlets where they can register and retrieve application objects by name with\\nsetAttribute and getAttribute. The ServletContext object implemented by\\nthe servlet container must be thread-safe, because it will necessarily be accessed\\nby multiple threads. Servlets need not use synchronization when calling set\\x02Attribute and getAttribute, but they may have to use synchronization when\\nusing the objects stored in the ServletContext. These objects are owned by the\\napplication; they are being stored for safekeeping by the servlet container on the\\napplication’s behalf. Like all shared objects, they must be shared safely; in or\\x02der to prevent interference from multiple threads accessing the same object con\\x02currently, they should either be thread-safe, effectively immutable, or explicitly\\nguarded by a lock.1\\n4.2 Instance confinement\\nIf an object is not thread-safe, several techniques can still let it be used safely in\\na multithreaded program. You can ensure that it is only accessed from a single\\nthread (thread confinement), or that all access to it is properly guarded by a lock.\\n1. Interestingly, the HttpSession object, which performs a similar function in the servlet framework,\\nmay have stricter requirements. Because the servlet container may access the objects in the HttpSes\\x02sion so they can be serialized for replication or passivation, they must be thread-safe because the\\ncontainer will be accessing them as well as the web application. (We say “may have” since replication\\nand passivation is outside of the servlet specification but is a common feature of servlet containers.)\\nptg\\n4.2. Instance confinement 59\\nEncapsulation simplifies making classes thread-safe by promoting instance con\\x02finement, often just called confinement [CPJ 2.3.3]. When an object is encapsulated\\nwithin another object, all code paths that have access to the encapsulated object\\nare known and can be therefore be analyzed more easily than if that object were\\naccessible to the entire program. Combining confinement with an appropriate\\nlocking discipline can ensure that otherwise non-thread-safe objects are used in a\\nthread-safe manner.\\nEncapsulating data within an object confines access to the data to the ob\\x02ject’s methods, making it easier to ensure that the data is always accessed\\nwith the appropriate lock held.\\nConfined objects must not escape their intended scope. An object may be\\nconfined to a class instance (such as a private class member), a lexical scope (such\\nas a local variable), or a thread (such as an object that is passed from method to\\nmethod within a thread, but not supposed to be shared across threads). Objects\\ndon’t escape on their own, of course—they need help from the developer, who\\nassists by publishing the object beyond its intended scope.\\nPersonSet in Listing 4.2 illustrates how confinement and locking can work\\ntogether to make a class thread-safe even when its component state variables are\\nnot. The state of PersonSet is managed by a HashSet, which is not thread-safe.\\nBut because mySet is private and not allowed to escape, the HashSet is confined\\nto the PersonSet. The only code paths that can access mySet are addPerson and\\ncontainsPerson, and each of these acquires the lock on the PersonSet. All its\\nstate is guarded by its intrinsic lock, making PersonSet thread-safe.\\n@ThreadSafe\\npublic class PersonSet {\\n@GuardedBy(\"this\")\\nprivate final Set<Person> mySet = new HashSet<Person>();\\npublic synchronized void addPerson(Person p) {\\nmySet.add(p);\\n}\\npublic synchronized boolean containsPerson(Person p) {\\nreturn mySet.contains(p);\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.2. Using confinement to ensure thread safety.\\nThis example makes no assumptions about the thread-safety of Person, but if\\nit is mutable, additional synchronization will be needed when accessing a Person\\nretrieved from a PersonSet. The most reliable way to do this would be to make\\nptg\\n60 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\nPerson thread-safe; less reliable would be to guard the Person objects with a lock\\nand ensure that all clients follow the protocol of acquiring the appropriate lock\\nbefore accessing the Person.\\nInstance confinement is one of the easiest ways to build thread-safe classes.\\nIt also allows flexibility in the choice of locking strategy; PersonSet happened\\nto use its own intrinsic lock to guard its state, but any lock, consistently used,\\nwould do just as well. Instance confinement also allows different state variables\\nto be guarded by different locks. (For an example of a class that uses multiple\\nlock objects to guard its state, see ServerStatus on page 236.)\\nThere are many examples of confinement in the platform class libraries, in\\x02cluding some classes that exist solely to turn non-thread-safe classes into thread\\x02safe ones. The basic collection classes such as ArrayList and HashMap are\\nnot thread-safe, but the class library provides wrapper factory methods (Col\\x02lections.synchronizedList and friends) so they can be used safely in multi\\x02threaded environments. These factories use the Decorator pattern (Gamma et al.,\\n1995) to wrap the collection with a synchronized wrapper object; the wrapper\\nimplements each method of the appropriate interface as a synchronized method\\nthat forwards the request to the underlying collection object. So long as the wrap\\x02per object holds the only reachable reference to the underlying collection (i.e.,\\nthe underlying collection is confined to the wrapper), the wrapper object is then\\nthread-safe. The Javadoc for these methods warns that all access to the underlying\\ncollection must be made through the wrapper.\\nOf course, it is still possible to violate confinement by publishing a suppos\\x02edly confined object; if an object is intended to be confined to a specific scope,\\nthen letting it escape from that scope is a bug. Confined objects can also escape\\nby publishing other objects such as iterators or inner class instances that may\\nindirectly publish the confined objects.\\nConfinement makes it easier to build thread-safe classes because a class\\nthat confines its state can be analyzed for thread safety without having to\\nexamine the whole program.\\n4.2.1 The Java monitor pattern\\nFollowing the principle of instance confinement to its logical conclusion leads\\nyou to the Java monitor pattern.\\n2 An object following the Java monitor pattern\\nencapsulates all its mutable state and guards it with the object’s own intrinsic\\nlock.\\nCounter in Listing 4.1 shows a typical example of this pattern. It encapsu\\x02lates one state variable, value, and all access to that state variable is through the\\nmethods of Counter, which are all synchronized.\\n2. The Java monitor pattern is inspired by Hoare’s work on monitors (Hoare, 1974), though there are\\nsignificant differences between this pattern and a true monitor. The bytecode instructions for entering\\nand exiting a synchronized block are even called monitorenter and monitorexit, and Java’s built-in\\n(intrinsic) locks are sometimes called monitor locks or monitors.\\nptg\\n4.2. Instance confinement 61\\nThe Java monitor pattern is used by many library classes, such as Vector and\\nHashtable. Sometimes a more sophisticated synchronization policy is needed;\\nChapter 11 shows how to improve scalability through finer-grained locking strate\\x02gies. The primary advantage of the Java monitor pattern is its simplicity.\\nThe Java monitor pattern is merely a convention; any lock object could be used\\nto guard an object’s state so long as it is used consistently. Listing 4.3 illustrates a\\nclass that uses a private lock to guard its state.\\npublic class PrivateLock {\\nprivate final Object myLock = new Object();\\n@GuardedBy(\"myLock\") Widget widget;\\nvoid someMethod() {\\nsynchronized(myLock) {\\n// Access or modify the state of widget\\n}\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.3. Guarding state with a private lock.\\nThere are advantages to using a private lock object instead of an object’s in\\x02trinsic lock (or any other publicly accessible lock). Making the lock object private\\nencapsulates the lock so that client code cannot acquire it, whereas a publicly\\naccessible lock allows client code to participate in its synchronization policy—\\ncorrectly or incorrectly. Clients that improperly acquire another object’s lock\\ncould cause liveness problems, and verifying that a publicly accessible lock is\\nproperly used requires examining the entire program rather than a single class.\\n4.2.2 Example: tracking fleet vehicles\\nCounter in Listing 4.1 is a concise, but trivial, example of the Java monitor pattern.\\nLet’s build a slightly less trivial example: a “vehicle tracker” for dispatching\\nfleet vehicles such as taxicabs, police cars, or delivery trucks. We’ll build it first\\nusing the monitor pattern, and then see how to relax some of the encapsulation\\nrequirements while retaining thread safety.\\nEach vehicle is identified by a String and has a location represented by (x, y)\\ncoordinates. The VehicleTracker classes encapsulate the identity and locations\\nof the known vehicles, making them well-suited as a data model in a model\\x02view-controller GUI application where it might be shared by a view thread and\\nmultiple updater threads. The view thread would fetch the names and locations\\nof the vehicles and render them on a display:\\nMap<String, Point> locations = vehicles.getLocations();\\nfor (String key : locations.keySet())\\nrenderVehicle(key, locations.get(key));\\nptg\\n62 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\nSimilarly, the updater threads would modify vehicle locations with data re\\x02ceived from GPS devices or entered manually by a dispatcher through a GUI\\ninterface:\\nvoid vehicleMoved(VehicleMovedEvent evt) {\\nPoint loc = evt.getNewLocation();\\nvehicles.setLocation(evt.getVehicleId(), loc.x, loc.y);\\n}\\nSince the view thread and the updater threads will access the data model\\nconcurrently, it must be thread-safe. Listing 4.4 shows an implementation of the\\nvehicle tracker using the Java monitor pattern that uses MutablePoint in Listing\\n4.5 for representing the vehicle locations.\\nEven though MutablePoint is not thread-safe, the tracker class is. Neither the\\nmap nor any of the mutable points it contains is ever published. When we need to\\nreturn vehicle locations to callers, the appropriate values are copied using either\\nthe MutablePoint copy constructor or deepCopy, which creates a new Map whose\\nvalues are copies of the keys and values from the old Map.\\n3\\nThis implementation maintains thread safety in part by copying mutable data\\nbefore returning it to the client. This is usually not a performance issue, but could\\nbecome one if the set of vehicles is very large.4 Another consequence of copying\\nthe data on each call to getLocation is that the contents of the returned collection\\ndo not change even if the underlying locations change. Whether this is good or\\nbad depends on your requirements. It could be a benefit if there are internal\\nconsistency requirements on the location set, in which case returning a consistent\\nsnapshot is critical, or a drawback if callers require up-to-date information for\\neach vehicle and therefore need to refresh their snapshot more often.\\n4.3 Delegating thread safety\\nAll but the most trivial objects are composite objects. The Java monitor pattern\\nis useful when building classes from scratch or composing classes out of objects\\nthat are not thread-safe. But what if the components of our class are already\\nthread-safe? Do we need to add an additional layer of thread safety? The answer\\nis . . . “it depends”. In some cases a composite made of thread-safe components is\\nthread-safe (Listings 4.7 and 4.9), and in others it is merely a good start (Listing\\n4.10).\\nIn CountingFactorizer on page 23, we added an AtomicLong to an otherwise\\nstateless object, and the resulting composite object was still thread-safe. Since the\\nstate of CountingFactorizer is the state of the thread-safe AtomicLong, and since\\nCountingFactorizer imposes no additional validity constraints on the state of the\\n3. Note that deepCopy can’t just wrap the Map with an unmodifiableMap, because that protects only\\nthe collection from modification; it does not prevent callers from modifying the mutable objects stored\\nin it. For the same reason, populating the HashMap in deepCopy via a copy constructor wouldn’t work\\neither, because only the references to the points would be copied, not the point objects themselves.\\n4. Because deepCopy is called from a synchronized method, the tracker’s intrinsic lock is held for the\\nduration of what might be a long-running copy operation, and this could degrade the responsiveness\\nof the user interface when many vehicles are being tracked.\\nptg\\n4.3.

We could say\\nthat CountingFactorizer delegates its thread safety responsibilities to the Atom\\x02icLong: CountingFactorizer is thread-safe because AtomicLong is.5\\n4.3.1 Example: vehicle tracker using delegation\\nAs a more substantial example of delegation, let’s construct a version of the ve\\x02hicle tracker that delegates to a thread-safe class. We store the locations in a\\nMap, so we start with a thread-safe Map implementation, ConcurrentHashMap. We\\nalso store the location using an immutable Point class instead of MutablePoint,\\nshown in Listing 4.6.\\n@Immutable\\npublic class Point {\\npublic final int x, y;\\npublic Point(int x, int y) {\\nthis.x = x;\\nthis.y = y;\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.6. Immutable Point class used by DelegatingVehicleTracker.\\nPoint is thread-safe because it is immutable. Immutable values can be freely\\nshared and published, so we no longer need to copy the locations when returning\\nthem.\\n5. If count were not final, the thread safety analysis of CountingFactorizer would be more com\\x02plicated. If CountingFactorizer could modify count to reference a different AtomicLong, we would\\nthen have to ensure that this update was visible to all threads that might access the count, and that\\nthere were no race conditions regarding the value of the count reference. This is another good reason\\nto use final fields wherever practical.\\nptg\\n4.3. Delegating thread safety 65\\nDelegatingVehicleTracker in Listing 4.7 does not use any explicit synchro\\x02nization; all access to state is managed by ConcurrentHashMap, and all the keys\\nand values of the Map are immutable.\\n@ThreadSafe\\npublic class DelegatingVehicleTracker {\\nprivate final ConcurrentMap<String, Point> locations;\\nprivate final Map<String, Point> unmodifiableMap;\\npublic DelegatingVehicleTracker(Map<String, Point> points) {\\nlocations = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, Point>(points);\\nunmodifiableMap = Collections.unmodifiableMap(locations);\\n}\\npublic Map<String, Point> getLocations() {\\nreturn unmodifiableMap;\\n}\\npublic Point getLocation(String id) {\\nreturn locations.get(id);\\n}\\npublic void setLocation(String id, int x, int y) {\\nif (locations.replace(id, new Point(x, y)) == null)\\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\\n\"invalid vehicle name: \" + id);\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.7. Delegating thread safety to a ConcurrentHashMap.\\nIf we had used the original MutablePoint class instead of Point, we would\\nbe breaking encapsulation by letting getLocations publish a reference to muta\\x02ble state that is not thread-safe. Notice that we’ve changed the behavior of the\\nvehicle tracker class slightly; while the monitor version returned a snapshot of\\nthe locations, the delegating version returns an unmodifiable but “live” view of\\nthe vehicle locations. This means that if thread A calls getLocations and thread\\nB later modifies the location of some of the points, those changes are reflected\\nin the Map returned to thread A. As we remarked earlier, this can be a benefit\\n(more up-to-date data) or a liability (potentially inconsistent view of the fleet),\\ndepending on your requirements.\\nIf an unchanging view of the fleet is required, getLocations could instead\\nreturn a shallow copy of the locations map. Since the contents of the Map are\\nimmutable, only the structure of the Map, not the contents, must be copied, as\\nshown in Listing 4.8 (which returns a plain HashMap, since getLocations did not\\npromise to return a thread-safe Map).\\nptg\\n66 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\npublic Map<String, Point> getLocations() {\\nreturn Collections.unmodifiableMap(\\nnew HashMap<String, Point>(locations));\\n}\\nListing 4.8. Returning a static copy of the location set instead of a “live” one.\\n4.3.2 Independent state variables\\nThe delegation examples so far delegate to a single, thread-safe state variable. We\\ncan also delegate thread safety to more than one underlying state variable as long\\nas those underlying state variables are independent, meaning that the composite\\nclass does not impose any invariants involving the multiple state variables.\\nVisualComponent in Listing 4.9 is a graphical component that allows clients to\\nregister listeners for mouse and keystroke events. It maintains a list of registered\\nlisteners of each type, so that when an event occurs the appropriate listeners\\ncan be invoked. But there is no relationship between the set of mouse listeners\\nand key listeners; the two are independent, and therefore VisualComponent can\\ndelegate its thread safety obligations to two underlying thread-safe lists.\\npublic class VisualComponent {\\nprivate final List<KeyListener> keyListeners\\n= new CopyOnWriteArrayList<KeyListener>();\\nprivate final List<MouseListener> mouseListeners\\n= new CopyOnWriteArrayList<MouseListener>();\\npublic void addKeyListener(KeyListener listener) {\\nkeyListeners.add(listener);\\n}\\npublic void addMouseListener(MouseListener listener) {\\nmouseListeners.add(listener);\\n}\\npublic void removeKeyListener(KeyListener listener) {\\nkeyListeners.remove(listener);\\n}\\npublic void removeMouseListener(MouseListener listener) {\\nmouseListeners.remove(listener);\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.9. Delegating thread safety to multiple underlying state variables.\\nVisualComponent uses a CopyOnWriteArrayList to store each listener list; this\\nptg\\n4.3. Delegating thread safety 67\\nis a thread-safe List implementation particularly suited for managing listener\\nlists (see Section 5.2.3). Each List is thread-safe, and because there are no con\\x02straints coupling the state of one to the state of the other, VisualComponent can\\ndelegate its thread safety responsibilities to the underlying mouseListeners and\\nkeyListeners objects.\\n4.3.3 When delegation fails\\nMost composite classes are not as simple as VisualComponent: they have invari\\x02ants that relate their component state variables. NumberRange in Listing 4.10 uses\\ntwo AtomicIntegers to manage its state, but imposes an additional constraint—\\nthat the first number be less than or equal to the second.\\npublic class NumberRange {\\n// INVARIANT: lower <= upper\\nprivate final AtomicInteger lower = new AtomicInteger(0);\\nprivate final AtomicInteger upper = new AtomicInteger(0);\\npublic void setLower(int i) {\\n// Warning -- unsafe check-then-act\\nif (i > upper.get())\\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\\n\"can’t set lower to \" + i + \" > upper\");\\nlower.set(i);\\n}\\npublic void setUpper(int i) {\\n// Warning -- unsafe check-then-act\\nif (i < lower.get())\\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\\n\"can’t set upper to \" + i + \" < lower\");\\nupper.set(i);\\n}\\npublic boolean isInRange(int i) {\\nreturn (i >= lower.get() && i <= upper.get());\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.10. Number range class that does not sufficiently protect its invariants.\\nDon’t do this.\\nNumberRange is not thread-safe; it does not preserve the invariant that con\\x02strains lower and upper. The setLower and setUpper methods attempt to respect\\nthis invariant, but do so poorly. Both setLower and setUpper are check-then-act\\nsequences, but they do not use sufficient locking to make them atomic. If the num\\x02ber range holds (0, 10), and one thread calls setLower(5) while another thread\\nptg\\n68 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\ncalls setUpper(4), with some unlucky timing both will pass the checks in the set\\x02ters and both modifications will be applied. The result is that the range now holds\\n(5, 4)—an invalid state. So while the underlying AtomicIntegers are thread-safe,\\nthe composite class is not. Because the underlying state variables lower and\\nupper are not independent, NumberRange cannot simply delegate thread safety to\\nits thread-safe state variables.\\nNumberRange could be made thread-safe by using locking to maintain its in\\x02variants, such as guarding lower and upper with a common lock. It must also\\navoid publishing lower and upper to prevent clients from subverting its invari\\x02ants.\\nIf a class has compound actions, as NumberRange does, delegation alone is\\nagain not a suitable approach for thread safety. In these cases, the class must\\nprovide its own locking to ensure that compound actions are atomic, unless the\\nentire compound action can also be delegated to the underlying state variables.\\nIf a class is composed of multiple independent thread-safe state variables\\nand has no operations that have any invalid state transitions, then it can\\ndelegate thread safety to the underlying state variables.\\nThe problem that prevented NumberRange from being thread-safe even though\\nits state components were thread-safe is very similar to one of the rules about\\nvolatile variables described in Section 3.1.4: a variable is suitable for being de\\x02clared volatile only if it does not participate in invariants involving other state\\nvariables.\\n4.3.4 Publishing underlying state variables\\nWhen you delegate thread safety to an object’s underlying state variables, under\\nwhat conditions can you publish those variables so that other classes can modify\\nthem as well? Again, the answer depends on what invariants your class imposes\\non those variables. While the underlying value field in Counter could take on\\nany integer value, Counter constrains it to take on only positive values, and the\\nincrement operation constrains the set of valid next states given any current state.\\nIf you were to make the value field public, clients could change it to an invalid\\nvalue, so publishing it would render the class incorrect. On the other hand, if\\na variable represents the current temperature or the ID of the last user to log\\non, then having another class modify this value at any time probably would not\\nviolate any invariants, so publishing this variable might be acceptable. (It still\\nmay not be a good idea, since publishing mutable variables constrains future\\ndevelopment and opportunities for subclassing, but it would not necessarily render\\nthe class not thread-safe.)\\nptg\\n4.3. Delegating thread safety 69\\nIf a state variable is thread-safe, does not participate in any invariants that\\nconstrain its value, and has no prohibited state transitions for any of its\\noperations, then it can safely be published.\\nFor example, it would be safe to publish mouseListeners or keyListeners in\\nVisualComponent. Because VisualComponent does not impose any constraints on\\nthe valid states of its listener lists, these fields could be made public or otherwise\\npublished without compromising thread safety.\\n4.3.5 Example: vehicle tracker that publishes its state\\nLet’s construct another version of the vehicle tracker that publishes its underlying\\nmutable state. Again, we need to modify the interface a little bit to accommodate\\nthis change, this time using mutable but thread-safe points.\\n@ThreadSafe\\npublic class SafePoint {\\n@GuardedBy(\"this\") private int x, y;\\nprivate SafePoint(int[] a) { this(a[0], a[1]); }\\npublic SafePoint(SafePoint p) { this(p.get()); }\\npublic SafePoint(int x, int y) {\\nthis.x = x;\\nthis.y = y;\\n}\\npublic synchronized int[] get() {\\nreturn new int[] { x, y };\\n}\\npublic synchronized void set(int x, int y) {\\nthis.x = x;\\nthis.y = y;\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.11. Thread-safe mutable point class.\\nSafePoint in Listing 4.11 provides a getter that retrieves both the x and y\\nvalues at once by returning a two-element array.6 If we provided separate getters\\n6. The private constructor exists to avoid the race condition that would occur if the copy constructor\\nwere implemented as this(p.x, p.y); this is an example of the private constructor capture idiom (Bloch\\nand Gafter, 2005).\\nptg\\n70 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\nfor x and y, then the values could change between the time one coordinate is\\nretrieved and the other, resulting in a caller seeing an inconsistent value: an (x, y)\\nlocation where the vehicle never was. Using SafePoint, we can construct a vehicle\\ntracker that publishes the underlying mutable state without undermining thread\\nsafety, as shown in the PublishingVehicleTracker class in Listing 4.12.\\n@ThreadSafe\\npublic class PublishingVehicleTracker {\\nprivate final Map<String, SafePoint> locations;\\nprivate final Map<String, SafePoint> unmodifiableMap;\\npublic PublishingVehicleTracker(\\nMap<String, SafePoint> locations) {\\nthis.locations\\n= new ConcurrentHashMap<String, SafePoint>(locations);\\nthis.unmodifiableMap\\n= Collections.unmodifiableMap(this.locations);\\n}\\npublic Map<String, SafePoint> getLocations() {\\nreturn unmodifiableMap;\\n}\\npublic SafePoint getLocation(String id) {\\nreturn locations.get(id);\\n}\\npublic void setLocation(String id, int x, int y) {\\nif (!locations.containsKey(id))\\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\\n\"invalid vehicle name: \" + id);\\nlocations.get(id).set(x, y);\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.12. Vehicle tracker that safely publishes underlying state.\\nPublishingVehicleTracker derives its thread safety from delegation to an un\\x02derlying ConcurrentHashMap, but this time the contents of the Map are thread-safe\\nmutable points rather than immutable ones. The getLocation method returns an\\nunmodifiable copy of the underlying Map. Callers cannot add or remove vehicles,\\nbut could change the location of one of the vehicles by mutating the SafePoint\\nvalues in the returned Map. Again, the “live” nature of the Map may be a benefit\\nor a drawback, depending on the requirements. PublishingVehicleTracker is\\nthread-safe, but would not be so if it imposed any additional constraints on the\\nvalid values for vehicle locations. If it needed to be able to “veto” changes to\\nptg\\n4.4. Adding functionality to existing thread-safe classes 71\\nvehicle locations or to take action when a location changes, the approach taken\\nby PublishingVehicleTracker would not be appropriate.\\n4.4 Adding functionality to existing thread-safe classes\\nThe Java class library contains many useful “building block” classes. Reusing\\nexisting classes is often preferable to creating new ones: reuse can reduce de\\x02velopment effort, development risk (because the existing components are already\\ntested), and maintenance cost. Sometimes a thread-safe class that supports all of\\nthe operations we want already exists, but often the best we can find is a class\\nthat supports almost all the operations we want, and then we need to add a new\\noperation to it without undermining its thread safety.\\nAs an example, let’s say we need a thread-safe List with an atomic put-if\\x02absent operation. The synchronized List implementations nearly do the job,\\nsince they provide the contains and add methods from which we can construct a\\nput-if-absent operation.\\nThe concept of put-if-absent is straightforward enough—check to see if an\\nelement is in the collection before adding it, and do not add it if it is already there.\\n(Your “check-then-act” warning bells should be going off now.) The requirement\\nthat the class be thread-safe implicitly adds another requirement—that operations\\nlike put-if-absent be atomic. Any reasonable interpretation suggests that, if you\\ntake a List that does not contain object X, and add X twice with put-if-absent,\\nthe resulting collection contains only one copy of X. But, if put-if-absent were\\nnot atomic, with some unlucky timing two threads could both see that X was not\\npresent and both add X, resulting in two copies of X.\\nThe safest way to add a new atomic operation is to modify the original class\\nto support the desired operation, but this is not always possible because you may\\nnot have access to the source code or may not be free to modify it. If you can\\nmodify the original class, you need to understand the implementation’s synchro\\x02nization policy so that you can enhance it in a manner consistent with its original\\ndesign. Adding the new method directly to the class means that all the code\\nthat implements the synchronization policy for that class is still contained in one\\nsource file, facilitating easier comprehension and maintenance.\\nAnother approach is to extend the class, assuming it was designed for exten\\x02sion. BetterVector in Listing 4.13 extends Vector to add a putIfAbsent method.\\nExtending Vector is straightforward enough, but not all classes expose enough\\nof their state to subclasses to admit this approach.\\nExtension is more fragile than adding code directly to a class, because the\\nimplementation of the synchronization policy is now distributed over multiple,\\nseparately maintained source files. If the underlying class were to change its\\nsynchronization policy by choosing a different lock to guard its state variables,\\nthe subclass would subtly and silently break, because it no longer used the right\\nlock to control concurrent access to the base class’s state. (The synchronization\\npolicy of Vector is fixed by its specification, so BetterVector would not suffer\\nfrom this problem.)\\nptg\\n72 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\n@ThreadSafe\\npublic class BetterVector<E> extends Vector<E> {\\npublic synchronized boolean putIfAbsent(E x) {\\nboolean absent = !contains(x);\\nif (absent)\\nadd(x);\\nreturn absent;\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.13. Extending Vector to have a put-if-absent method.\\n4.4.1 Client-side locking\\nFor an ArrayList wrapped with a Collections.synchronizedList wrapper, nei\\x02ther of these approaches—adding a method to the original class or extending the\\nclass—works because the client code does not even know the class of the List\\nobject returned from the synchronized wrapper factories. A third strategy is to\\nextend the functionality of the class without extending the class itself by placing\\nextension code in a “helper” class.\\nListing 4.14 shows a failed attempt to create a helper class with an atomic\\nput-if-absent operation for operating on a thread-safe List.\\n@NotThreadSafe\\npublic class ListHelper<E> {\\npublic List<E> list =\\nCollections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<E>());\\n...\\npublic synchronized boolean putIfAbsent(E x) {\\nboolean absent = !list.contains(x);\\nif (absent)\\nlist.add(x);\\nreturn absent;\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.14. Non-thread-safe attempt to implement put-if-absent. Don’t do this.\\nWhy wouldn’t this work? After all, putIfAbsent is synchronized, right? The\\nproblem is that it synchronizes on the wrong lock. Whatever lock the List uses\\nto guard its state, it sure isn’t the lock on the ListHelper. ListHelper provides\\nonly the illusion of synchronization; the various list operations, while all synchro\\x02nized, use different locks, which means that putIfAbsent is not atomic relative to\\nother operations on the List. So there is no guarantee that another thread won’t\\nmodify the list while putIfAbsent is executing.\\nptg\\n4.4. Adding functionality to existing thread-safe classes 73\\nTo make this approach work, we have to use the same lock that the List uses\\nby using client-side locking or external locking. Client-side locking entails guarding\\nclient code that uses some object X with the lock X uses to guard its own state.\\nIn order to use client-side locking, you must know what lock X uses.\\nThe documentation for Vector and the synchronized wrapper classes states,\\nalbeit obliquely, that they support client-side locking, by using the intrinsic lock\\nfor the Vector or the wrapper collection (not the wrapped collection). Listing\\n4.15 shows a putIfAbsent operation on a thread-safe List that correctly uses\\nclient-side locking.\\n@ThreadSafe\\npublic class ListHelper<E> {\\npublic List<E> list =\\nCollections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<E>());\\n...\\npublic boolean putIfAbsent(E x) {\\nsynchronized (list) {\\nboolean absent = !list.contains(x);\\nif (absent)\\nlist.add(x);\\nreturn absent;\\n}\\n}\\n}\\nListing 4.15. Implementing put-if-absent with client-side locking.\\nIf extending a class to add another atomic operation is fragile because it dis\\x02tributes the locking code for a class over multiple classes in an object hierarchy,\\nclient-side locking is even more fragile because it entails putting locking code\\nfor class C into classes that are totally unrelated to C. Exercise care when using\\nclient-side locking on classes that do not commit to their locking strategy.\\nClient-side locking has a lot in common with class extension—they both cou\\x02ple the behavior of the derived class to the implementation of the base class. Just\\nas extension violates encapsulation of implementation [EJ Item 14], client-side\\nlocking violates encapsulation of synchronization policy.\\n4.4.2 Composition\\nThere is a less fragile alternative for adding an atomic operation to an existing\\nclass: composition. ImprovedList in Listing 4.16 implements the List operations\\nby delegating them to an underlying List instance, and adds an atomic put\\x02IfAbsent method. (Like Collections.synchronizedList and other collections\\nwrappers, ImprovedList assumes that once a list is passed to its constructor, the\\nclient will not use the underlying list directly again, accessing it only through the\\nImprovedList.)\\nptg\\n74 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\n@ThreadSafe\\npublic class ImprovedList<T> implements List<T> {\\nprivate final List<T> list;\\npublic ImprovedList(List<T> list) { this.list = list; }\\npublic synchronized boolean putIfAbsent(T x) {\\nboolean contains = list.contains(x);\\nif (contains)\\nlist.add(x);\\nreturn !contains;\\n}\\npublic synchronized void clear() { list.clear(); }\\n// ... similarly delegate other List methods\\n}\\nListing 4.16. Implementing put-if-absent using composition.\\nImprovedList adds an additional level of locking using its own intrinsic lock.\\nIt does not care whether the underlying List is thread-safe, because it provides\\nits own consistent locking that provides thread safety even if the List is not\\nthread-safe or changes its locking implementation. While the extra layer of syn\\x02chronization may add some small performance penalty,7 the implementation in\\nImprovedList is less fragile than attempting to mimic the locking strategy of an\\x02other object. In effect, we’ve used the Java monitor pattern to encapsulate an\\nexisting List, and this is guaranteed to provide thread safety so long as our class\\nholds the only outstanding reference to the underlying List.\\n4.5 Documenting synchronization policies\\nDocumentation is one of the most powerful (and, sadly, most underutilized) tools\\nfor managing thread safety. Users look to the documentation to find out if a\\nclass is thread-safe, and maintainers look to the documentation to understand\\nthe implementation strategy so they can maintain it without inadvertently com\\x02promising safety. Unfortunately, both of these constituencies usually find less\\ninformation in the documentation than they’d like.\\nDocument a class’s thread safety guarantees for its clients; document its\\nsynchronization policy for its maintainers.\\n7. The penalty will be small because the synchronization on the underlying List is guaranteed to be\\nuncontended and therefore fast; see Chapter 11.\\nptg\\n4.5. Documenting synchronization policies 75\\nEach use of synchronized, volatile, or any thread-safe class reflects a syn\\x02chronization policy defining a strategy for ensuring the integrity of data in the face\\nof concurrent access. That policy is an element of your program’s design, and\\nshould be documented. Of course, the best time to document design decisions\\nis at design time. Weeks or months later, the details may be a blur—so write it\\ndown before you forget.\\nCrafting a synchronization policy requires a number of decisions: which vari\\x02ables to make volatile, which variables to guard with locks, which lock(s) guard\\nwhich variables, which variables to make immutable or confine to a thread, which\\noperations must be atomic, etc. Some of these are strictly implementation details\\nand should be documented for the sake of future maintainers, but some affect the\\npublicly observable locking behavior of your class and should be documented as\\npart of its specification.\\nAt the very least, document the thread safety guarantees made by a class. Is\\nit thread-safe? Does it make callbacks with a lock held? Are there any specific\\nlocks that affect its behavior? Don’t force clients to make risky guesses. If you\\ndon’t want to commit to supporting client-side locking, that’s fine, but say so. If\\nyou want clients to be able to create new atomic operations on your class, as we\\ndid in Section 4.4, you need to document which locks they should acquire to do\\nso safely. If you use locks to guard state, document this for future maintainers,\\nbecause it’s so easy—the @GuardedBy annotation will do the trick. If you use more\\nsubtle means to maintain thread safety, document them because they may not be\\nobvious to maintainers.\\nThe current state of affairs in thread safety documentation, even in the plat\\x02form library classes, is not encouraging. How many times have you looked at\\nthe Javadoc for a class and wondered whether it was thread-safe?8 Most classes\\ndon’t offer any clue either way. Many official Java technology specifications, such\\nas servlets and JDBC, woefully underdocument their thread safety promises and\\nrequirements.\\nWhile prudence suggests that we not assume behaviors that aren’t part of the\\nspecification, we have work to get done, and we are often faced with a choice of\\nbad assumptions. Should we assume an object is thread-safe because it seems that\\nit ought to be? Should we assume that access to an object can be made thread-safe\\nby acquiring its lock first? (This risky technique works only if we control all the\\ncode that accesses that object; otherwise, it provides only the illusion of thread\\nsafety.) Neither choice is very satisfying.\\nTo make matters worse, our intuition may often be wrong on which classes\\nare “probably thread-safe” and which are not. As an example, java.text.Sim\\x02pleDateFormat isn’t thread-safe, but the Javadoc neglected to mention this until\\nJDK 1.4. That this particular class isn’t thread-safe comes as a surprise to many\\ndevelopers. How many programs mistakenly create a shared instance of a non\\x02thread-safe object and used it from multiple threads, unaware that this might\\ncause erroneous results under heavy load?\\nThe problem with SimpleDateFormat could be avoided by not assuming a\\nclass is thread-safe if it doesn’t say so. On the other hand, it is impossible to\\n8. If you’ve never wondered this, we admire your optimism.\\nptg\\n76 Chapter 4. Composing Objects\\ndevelop a servlet-based application without making some pretty questionable\\nassumptions about the thread safety of container-provided objects like HttpSes\\x02sion. Don’t make your customers or colleagues have to make guesses like this.\\n4.5.1 Interpreting vague documentation\\nMany Java technology specifications are silent, or at least unforthcoming, about\\nthread safety guarantees and requirements for interfaces such as ServletContext,\\nHttpSession, or DataSource.\\n9 Since these interfaces are implemented by your\\ncontainer or database vendor, you often can’t look at the code to see what it does.\\nBesides, you don’t want to rely on the implementation details of one particular\\nJDBC driver—you want to be compliant with the standard so your code works\\nproperly with any JDBC driver. But the words “thread” and “concurrent” do\\nnot appear at all in the JDBC specification, and appear frustratingly rarely in the\\nservlet specification. So what do you do?\\nYou are going to have to guess. One way to improve the quality of your\\nguess is to interpret the specification from the perspective of someone who will\\nimplement it (such as a container or database vendor), as opposed to someone\\nwho will merely use it. Servlets are always called from a container-managed\\nthread, and it is safe to assume that if there is more than one such thread, the\\ncontainer knows this. The servlet container makes available certain objects that\\nprovide service to multiple servlets, such as HttpSession or ServletContext. So\\nthe servlet container should expect to have these objects accessed concurrently,\\nsince it has created multiple threads and called methods like Servlet.service\\nfrom them that could reasonably be expected to access the ServletContext.\\nSince it is impossible to imagine a single-threaded context in which these ob\\x02jects would be useful, one has to assume that they have been made thread-safe,\\neven though the specification does not explicitly require this. Besides, if they re\\x02quired client-side locking, on what lock should the client code synchronize? The\\ndocumentation doesn’t say, and it seems absurd to guess. This “reasonable as\\x02sumption” is further bolstered by the examples in the specification and official\\ntutorials that show how to access ServletContext or HttpSession and do not\\nuse any client-side synchronization.\\nOn the other hand, the objects placed in the ServletContext or HttpSession\\nwith setAttribute are owned by the web application, not the servlet container.\\nThe servlet specification does not suggest any mechanism for coordinating con\\x02current access to shared attributes. So attributes stored by the container on behalf\\nof the web application should be thread-safe or effectively immutable. If all the\\ncontainer did was store these attributes on behalf of the web application, another\\noption would be to ensure that they are consistently guarded by a lock when\\naccessed from servlet application code. But because the container may want to\\nserialize objects in the HttpSession for replication or passivation purposes, and\\nthe servlet container can’t possibly know your locking protocol, you should make\\nthem thread-safe.\\n9. We find it particularly frustrating that these omissions persist despite multiple major revisions of\\nthe specifications.\\nptg\\n4.5. Documenting synchronization policies 77\\nOne can make a similar inference about the JDBC DataSource interface, which\\nrepresents a pool of reusable database connections. A DataSource provides ser\\x02vice to an application, and it doesn’t make much sense in the context of a single\\x02threaded application. It is hard to imagine a use case that doesn’t involve calling\\ngetConnection from multiple threads. And, as with servlets, the examples in\\nthe JDBC specification do not suggest the need for any client-side locking in the\\nmany code examples using DataSource. So, even though the specification doesn’t\\npromise that DataSource is thread-safe or require container vendors to provide a\\nthread-safe implementation, by the same “it would be absurd if it weren’t” argu\\x02ment, we have no choice but to assume that DataSource.getConnection does not\\nrequire additional client-side locking.\\nOn the other hand, we would not make the same argument about the JDBC\\nConnection objects dispensed by the DataSource, since these are not necessarily\\nintended to be shared by other activities until they are returned to the pool. So if\\nan activity that obtains a JDBC Connection spans multiple threads, it must take\\nresponsibility for ensuring that access to the Connection is properly guarded by\\nsynchronization.
